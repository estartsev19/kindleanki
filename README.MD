Kindle To Anki Console Application
==================================

## What is it for?
This application allows you to transfer the words you learn and their usage from your Kindle Paperwhite (Vocabulary Builder) into a CSV file. By manually adding a translation or definition to the third column of the csv file, the file can be imported into Anki.

## Usage
1. Build the jar file with gradle.
2. Create a new folder, where you place the created jar file and vocab.db file.
3. Run the jar file from the console. The generated .csv file will be located in this directory.
